ANT FARM SIMULATION

A side view of a Terraria-like ant farm simulation.
A bunch of robots find them selves booted up on a mysterious planet, what do they do but mine?
What do they do but build?
Give them a ton of actions and different aptitudes. Kinda like rimworld

Basic rendering and backgrounds created.

TODO:
 - Want to create a player agent which can walk around and break things
 - Make water flow a little to even out
 - Fix map generation
 - Render a chunk as a surface and only update that chunk render when block updates happen


 Aptitudes:
  - Clutter Removal: Break the most isolated block in radius
  - Path finder
  - Edge seeker
  - Chaos: Random
